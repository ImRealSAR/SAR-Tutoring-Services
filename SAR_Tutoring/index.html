      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <div class="tutor-card">
        <h2>Hey! This is your friendly neighborhood tutor, Sazid Rob!</h2>
        <p>I‚Äôm a rising senior from Stamford, CT, offering private tutoring this summer for <strong>students in grades 5‚Äì9</strong>.</p>

        <p>I know school can feel confusing sometimes, or maybe you or your student never got a good grasp of some class material. So be it  math, reading, or writing. I‚Äôve been there. Over time, I figured out how to make things simpler for both myself and even my peers by explaining them step-by-step. That‚Äôs what I try to do now: keep it simple, patient, and real.</p>

        <h3>üìö Subjects I Tutor:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Math</li>
          <li>English / Reading</li>
          <li>Essay writing</li>
          <li>Coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python)</li>
          <li>Public speaking, oratory, & debate</li>
          <li>Intro to AI Prompt Engineering</li>
          <li>Summer Assignment(s) for school!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I offer sessions online or in-person at the Ferguson Library. There‚Äôs no pressure and no judgment ‚Äî just clear help for you/your student, who wants to improve.</p>

  <h1>Subjects I Tutor</h1>
  <p>Each subject has its own purpose. So here‚Äôs the tea I spilled into various cards for your understanding! Or simply put-- what I cover and why it matters.</p>

  <div class="subject-cards">

    </div>

    <div class="subject-card">
      <h2>English / Reading</h2>
      <p>From reading passages to comprehension skills, I will help guide students in understanding texts deeply and answering questions effectively with clarity and calmness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject-card">

    </div>

    <div class="subject-card">
      <h2>Public Speaking & Debate</h2>
      <p>Learning to present or speak in public is without doubt, an essential skill for any field or goal in life. It always helps!

    </div>

    <div class="subject-card">
      <h2>AI Prompt Engineering</h2>
      <p>Curious about AI? Or maybe not. However, learning to properly & effectively use AI would surely be a handy skill! It‚Äôs not about just getting free answers from ChatGPT. Let's collaborate with it to make the best of AI, and our hunger to learn more! I teach how to write smart prompts, think critically, and use AI in creative ways. Future-ready, fun, and beginner-friendly.</p>
